# tcx-streetview-checker
<b>Currently testing package formatting. The app contained is not the actual app (described below), but is the [Faithful](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/faithful.html) testing app provided by Rstudio.</b>

This is a shiny app to help route planners (predominantly road cyclists) to ensure that their route sticks to roads, and not off-road tracks and bridle paths.

The user uploads a route in `.tcx` format, and the app then checks whether or not Google Streetview has visited locations along the route.
