# tcxStreetviewR
This is a shiny app to help route planners (predominantly road cyclists) to ensure that their route sticks to roads, and not off-road tracks and bridle paths.

The user uploads a route in `.tcx` format, and the app then checks whether or not Google Streetview has visited locations along the route.

<b>Note: To use this app you will require keys for both the [Google Street View Static API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro), and the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/). Template files for how to provide these is to follow.</b>
